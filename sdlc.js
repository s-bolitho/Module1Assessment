const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "Determining user expectations for a new or modified product. These requirements must be quantifiable, relevant, and detailed."
const design = "A process to transform user requirements into some suitable form, which helps the programmer in software coding and implementation."
const implementation = "The process of adopting and integrating a software application into a businedd workflow."
const testingAndIntegration = "A type of software testing in which the different units, modules, or components of a software application are tested as a combined entity."
const maintain = "The process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs. Software maintenance is done after the product has launched for several reasons including improving the software overall, correcting issues or bugs, to boost performance, and more."
